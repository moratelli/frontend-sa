# Poup (frontend)

A personal expenses tracker made with React. It features a sleek dashboard, where it is possible to track the latest transactions and get a simple feedback based on the user's latest 10 transactions. Poup also has charts, where users can see exactly how their money is spent. Lastly, it also has fully automated end-to-end tests, made with Cypress.

Poup is the final project of SENAI'S 2019 "Systems Development" course. It was made by Pedro Moratelli, Arthur Felix and Thiago Panchiniak.

You can find Poup's backend [here](https://github.com/ArthurUFelix/api-sa).
